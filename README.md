Recipe App

A web application with different recipes from the Spoonacular open API.

- Why did I make this project?
I always have a hard time coming up with what to make for dinner so I needed some sort of application where you can just type a keyword or look through different categories and it will give you a variety of recipes. So I thought why not make something useful like that while I get to practice my Frotnend skills? 

- What technologies did I use?
  - React JS
  - Styled Components

- What did I learn?
Learning how to set a project structure is always a continous learning and this is something I kept practicing throughout this project. A big takeway I take with me from this is how to display (in this case) a particular recipe by passing the ID with props.
